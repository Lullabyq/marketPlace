# Disclaimer: This is just a part of the team-build project

This components was made solely by me and belongs to a project that was made during EPAM training course.

Here you can find only a frontend part af the application.

Some guidelines:
- `Integratianal` and `unit` tests inside components;
- Usage of `Draft.js` in WYSIWYG component;
- Redux usage inside ***src/store/feedback***;
- Completly reworked structure of a whole page is devided between ***src/pages/*** and ***src/components*** folders
